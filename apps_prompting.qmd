*Tentative time: 12 minutes*

### Learning Objectives

-   Master the fundamentals of effective prompting
-   Transform vague requests into powerful prompts
-   Avoid common mistakes
-   Create reusable professional context for better AI interactions

## The Power and the Problem

Large Language Models are incredibly powerful tools, but they're not clairvoyant. As Ethan Mollick observed in his work on "[good enough prompting](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/getting-started-with-ai-good-enough)":

> "LLMs (such as ChatGPT, Claude, or Bard) are powerful but not clairvoyant. They need sufficient information and clarity to produce useful responses."

This insight captures a fundamental truth about working with AI: the quality of what you get out depends heavily on the quality of what you put in. But unlike Google searches where you can get away with a few keywords, LLMs work best when you treat them like a collaborative partner who needs context and clear direction.

Let's break down what this means practically:

**"Powerful"** - LLMs can handle complex tasks that would take humans hours or days: summarizing dozens of papers, translating between languages, analyzing patterns in data, or drafting professional documents. They have access to vast knowledge and can process large amounts of text quickly.

**"But not clairvoyant"** - They can't read your mind or guess what you really need. They don't know if you're writing for undergraduates or policymakers, whether you need a formal or casual tone, or what specific angle matters most for your research.

**"Need sufficient information and clarity"** - The more context and specific instructions you provide, the better the output. This is where prompt engineering comes in.

## From Our Mental Model to Better Prompts

Remember our "jagged frontier" mental model from Chapter 1? LLMs excel at some tasks (like summarizing text or finding patterns) but struggle with others (like providing current information or understanding subtle context). Good prompting helps you:

1.  **Navigate the jagged frontier** - Direct the AI toward tasks it handles well
2.  **Provide human expertise** - Give the AI the context and knowledge it lacks
3.  **Maintain quality control** - Structure requests so you can easily evaluate the output

Think of it this way: you bring the expertise and judgment, the AI brings the scale and speed. But you need to communicate effectively to make this partnership work.

## The Power of Chaining Prompts

One advanced technique worth mentioning is **prompt chaining** - breaking complex tasks into sequential steps rather than asking for everything at once. This often produces better results because:

-   Each step can be optimized for a specific task
-   You can review and refine the output before moving to the next step
-   The AI has clearer focus at each stage
-   You maintain better quality control throughout the process

For example, instead of asking "analyze this email thread and draft a response," you might: 1. First, ask for analysis and clarification 2. Then, ask for a draft response based on that analysis

This approach is particularly valuable for complex or high-stakes communications where you want to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.

## Two Powerful Prompt Enhancers

Before we move to the templates, here are two simple additions that can dramatically improve your prompts:

**"Please ask me clarifying questions"** - This encourages the AI to seek additional information rather than making assumptions. It's surprisingly effective at producing more tailored and useful outputs.

**"Tell me when you're unsure about something"** - This helps reduce hallucinations by encouraging the AI to admit uncertainty rather than fabricating plausible-sounding answers.

These simple additions can save you from misleading or inappropriate responses, especially when dealing with complex or sensitive topics.

## The Anatomy of an Effective Prompt

Based on research from Anthropic and other AI labs, effective prompts typically include:

## Essential Prompt Components

**Context** - Who you are, what you're working on, what the AI needs to know **Task** - What specifically you want the AI to do\
**Format** - How you want the output structured **Constraints** - Any limitations, requirements, or things to avoid **Examples** - Sample inputs/outputs if helpful
:::

For academic research, this might look like:

```         
Context: I'm a development researcher studying urban poverty in South Asia
Task: Summarize the key findings from this paper about migration patterns
Format: 3-4 bullet points focusing on policy implications
Constraints: Keep it under 200 words, use objective academic language
[Then upload or paste the paper or abstract]
```

## Hands-On Activity: Building Your Research Context

Let's practice with something directly useful for your research. We'll create a professional context that you can reuse across different AI conversations.

### Step 1: Create Your Professional Context

Copy and modify this template with your own information:

``` markdown
# [Your Name] - Professional Context

## Domain Expertise & Background
[Describe your main research areas, methodology preferences, and key expertise. Include your educational background and any relevant professional experience.]

## Current Roles & Affiliations
[List your current positions, institutional affiliations, and key responsibilities]

## Research Focus Areas
[Outline your main research interests and current projects]

## Communication Style & Audience
[Describe who you typically write for and how you prefer to communicate research findings]

## Technical Approach
[Mention any specific tools, methods, or analytical approaches you use]
```

::: callout-tip
## Example Professional Context

Here's how this might look for a researcher:

``` markdown
# Teal Emery - Professional Context

## Domain Expertise & Background
I'm a research consultant specializing in sovereign debt, emerging markets, and Chinese lending to developing countries. I combine domain expertise with data science tools to turn complex information into actionable insights. I have 10+ years of experience as an emerging markets investor and analyst, including 7 years at Morgan Stanley as a sovereign research analyst covering China, Africa, the Middle East, and other emerging markets.

## Current Roles & Affiliations
- Founder & Lead Researcher at Teal Insights
- Research Consultant at AidData
- Fellow at Energy for Growth Hub
- Adjunct Lecturer at Johns Hopkins SAIS

## Research Focus Areas
- Sovereign debt sustainability and restructuring
- Chinese lending and development finance
- Renewable energy financing in low-income countries
- Building transparent, reproducible research tools

## Communication Style & Audience
I write for policymakers, economists, and graduate students who are intelligent but may not share my specific domain expertise. I value clarity over complexity and aim to make technical concepts accessible without oversimplification.
```

### Step 2: Test the Difference

Now let's see how context changes AI responses. Try these two prompts with your chosen AI tool:

**Prompt A (Without Context):**

``` markdown         
What are some important research questions about social protection in developing countries?
```

**Prompt B (With Context):**

``` markdown         
[Paste your professional context here]

Given my research background and expertise, what are 5 specific research questions about social protection in developing countries that would be valuable and feasible for my work? Focus on areas where my mixed-methods approach and regional expertise would be particularly valuable.
```

### Step 3: Observe and Refine

Compare the two outputs: - Which response is more specific and useful? - Which better reflects your actual research interests? - How might you refine your context or prompt for even better results?

## Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

### Mistake 1: Treating AI Like Google

**Problem:** Asking factual questions without context **Instead:** Provide documents and ask for analysis

❌ "What's the poverty rate in Nigeria?" ✅ "Based on the survey data I'm sharing below, what are the key trends in poverty rates across different regions of Nigeria?"

### Mistake 2: Vague Requests

**Problem:** "Tell me about X" or "Help me with Y" **Instead:** Be specific about the task and output format

❌ "Help me with my literature review" ✅ "Summarize the main arguments from these 5 papers about microfinance, focusing on conflicting findings about impact on women's empowerment. Format as a comparison table."

### Mistake 3: No Quality Control

**Problem:** Accepting AI output without verification **Instead:** Ask for sources, evidence, or reasoning

❌ Just using whatever the AI produces ✅ "Show me the specific quotes from the papers that support each of these conclusions"

### Mistake 4: Overwhelming the AI

**Problem:** Asking for too much at once **Instead:** Break complex tasks into steps

❌ "Analyze this dataset, create visualizations, write a report, and suggest policy recommendations" ✅ "First, help me identify the key patterns in this dataset. Then we'll work on visualizations."

## Templates for Common Research Tasks

Here are some proven prompt templates you can adapt:

### Complex Email Thread Analysis

``` markdown         
[Your professional context]

I need to respond to this complex email thread. Please help me by:
1. Summarizing the key issues being discussed
2. Identifying what questions or decisions need my input
3. Noting any deadlines or urgent items
4. Flagging any potential conflicts or sensitive topics
5. Suggesting 2-3 key points for my response

Upload the entire email thread below. Include any relevant background context about the project, relationships, or institutional dynamics that might help me craft an appropriate response.

Please ask me clarifying questions if anything is unclear, and tell me when you're unsure about something rather than guessing.

Email thread: [upload the full thread]
Additional context: [describe the project, your role, any politics or sensitivities]
```

**Follow-up prompt for drafting:**

``` markdown         
Based on your analysis above, please draft a professional response email that:
- Addresses the key points requiring my input
- Maintains an appropriate tone for the relationships involved
- Includes any necessary next steps or commitments
