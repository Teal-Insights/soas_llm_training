## Gems Across Platforms

Google calls them "Gems," but the concept exists across all major AI platforms:

- **Google Gemini:** Gems
- **Claude:** Projects  
- **ChatGPT:** Custom GPTs

The functionality is essentially the same—you're creating a specialized version of the AI with specific instructions and context.
:::

**Why Gems are valuable:**

- **Consistency:** Your Gem applies the same high-quality instructions every time
- **Efficiency:** No need to re-enter your professional context or detailed instructions
- **Specialization:** Each Gem can be optimized for specific research tasks
- **Sharing:** You can share useful Gems with colleagues (though be mindful of any sensitive context)

## Hands-On Activity: Create Your First Gem

Let's practice by creating your professional context Gem:

1. **Open Gemini** and navigate to Gems
2. **Create a new Gem** using the template above
3. **Fill in your specific details** (research areas, expertise, communication style)
4. **Test your Gem** with a research question you're currently working on
5. **Refine the instructions** based on the quality of the response

Then, if time permits, create a second Gem for a specific research task you do regularly.

## What Can Go Wrong (and How to Fix It)

### Common Issues:

**Too generic:** Gem instructions that are too broad produce mediocre results
**→ Solution:** Be specific about your research context and preferred outputs

**Too rigid:** Overly detailed instructions that don't allow for flexibility
**→ Solution:** Provide clear guidance while leaving room for the AI to adapt to different queries

**Outdated context:** Gems that don't reflect your current research focus
**→ Solution:** Regularly review and update your Gems as your research evolves

**Forgetting to save:** Working with a Gem in preview mode without saving
**→ Solution:** Always click "Save" after creating or editing a Gem

## Integration with Your Research Workflow

Gems work best when they become part of your regular research routine:

- **Daily literature review**: Use your Literature Review Gem for new papers
- **Weekly planning**: Use your Professional Context Gem for project prioritization
- **Grant deadlines**: Use your Grant Writing Gem for proposal development
- **Data analysis sessions**: Use your Data Analysis Gem for statistical guidance

## What You Can Do Now

1. **Create your Professional Context Gem** using the template provided
2. **Test it with a current research question** to see how context improves responses
3. **Identify 2-3 routine research tasks** that would benefit from specialized Gems
4. **Create one task-specific Gem** for your most common research need
5. **Share your best Gems** with colleagues (being mindful of privacy)

## Going Deeper

The same principles apply to Claude Projects and ChatGPT Custom GPTs. Once you master Gems, you can create similar specialized assistants across all major AI platforms, giving you flexible options for different research needs.

Remember: the goal isn't to create perfect Gems immediately, but to build a library of increasingly useful research tools that evolve with your work. Start simple, iterate based on what you learn, and gradually develop more sophisticated specialized assistants.
