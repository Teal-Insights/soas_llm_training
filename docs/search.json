    "text": "Understanding LLMs in Research Context\nLarge Language Models represent a new category of research tool. Like any emerging technology, they come with significant limitations: training data biases, lack of contextual understanding, tendency to generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information, and important ethical considerations around consent and knowledge production.\nHowever, when used strategically and with appropriate validation, these tools can transform research workflows. By automating time-consuming routine tasks—initial literature categorization, draft translations, basic coding—LLMs free researchers to dedicate more time to what humans do best: critical analysis, theoretical development, contextual interpretation, and ethical judgment.",

Instead, we focus on practical applications where LLMs demonstrably save time and enhance research capacity while maintaining academic standards.\nThroughout, we’ll use clear language and define technical terms as they arise. When we discuss “context windows,” we’ll explain this means how much text an AI can process at once. When we mention “hallucinations,” we’ll clarify this refers to AI’s tendency to generate false but plausible information.",

    "text": "1.1 How I Got Here\nCarlos Oya reached out after seeing a recent ODI Global paper I co-authored with Yunnan Chen called Greener on the other side? Mapping China’s overseas co-financing and financial innovation. We used a novel LLM-based approach to classify “green” Chinese lending projects—something that would have taken a large research team months to do manually.\nWhen we did this work, I looked for “best practices” for validating LLM findings. There weren’t many. So we developed our own validation method and published both a methodological appendix and our GitHub repository. It’s not perfect, but it’s something for others to build upon.\nThis experience showed me how LLMs can enhance what’s possible for policy-relevant research. Two policy researchers on a tight budget accomplished what traditionally required large, grant-funded research teams. There’s a long way to go to establish best practices for the use of LLMs in policy research, so I’m trying to do my best to move the conversation forward.",
