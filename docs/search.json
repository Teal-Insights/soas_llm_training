    "text": "1.1 How I Got Here\nCarlos Oya reached out after seeing a recent ODI Global paper I co-authored with Yunnan Chen called Greener on the other side? Mapping China’s overseas co-financing and financial innovation. We used a novel LLM-based approach to classify “green” Chinese lending projects—something that would have taken a large research team months to do manually.\nWhen we did this work, I looked for “best practices” for validating LLM findings. There weren’t many. So we developed our own validation method and published both a methodological appendix and our GitHub repository. It’s not perfect, but it’s something for others to build upon.\nThis experience showed me how LLMs can enhance what’s possible for policy-relevant research. Two policy researchers on a tight budget accomplished what traditionally required large, grant-funded research teams. There’s a long way to go to establish best practices for the use of LLMs in policy research, so I’m trying to do my best to move the conversation forward.",

Ethan Mollick suggests a particularly useful analogy:\n\ntreat AI like an infinitely patient new coworker who forgets everything you tell them each new conversation, one that comes highly recommended but whose actual abilities are not that clear.\n\nThis analogy helps us understand how to work with AI effectively:\nHuman-like aspects:\n\nNew on the job: Needs clear instructions and guidance, may not understand your specific context\nCoworker relationship: Works best through collaboration and back-and-forth dialogue\n\nNon-human aspects:\n\nInfinite patience: Never gets frustrated with repetitive requests or extensive revisions\nComplete forgetfulness: Starts fresh in each conversation with no memory of previous interactions\n\nUnlike traditional software that follows predictable rules, LLMs work more like collaborating with a capable but quirky colleague who can be creative and insightful, but may also confidently present plausible-sounding information that’s completely wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Ethan Mollick’s Work\n\n\n\nThis chapter builds heavily on the work of Ethan Mollick, particularly his concept of the “jagged frontier” and his research on human-AI collaboration.

    "text": "2.4 The Jagged Frontier: Understanding AI’s Uneven Capabilities\nThe most important concept for working with LLMs is what Mollick (& esteemed co-authors) calls the “jagged frontier” of AI capabilities. Imagine a fortress wall with towers and battlements jutting out at irregular points. Some parts of the wall extend far into the countryside, while others fold back toward the center. This wall represents AI’s capabilities—everything inside the wall represents tasks AI can handle well, while everything outside represents tasks where AI struggles.\n\n\n\nJagged Frontier of AI Capabilities\n\n\nThe challenge is that this wall is invisible. Tasks that seem equally difficult to humans often fall on opposite sides of the frontier. For example:\nInside the Frontier (AI excels):\n\nSummarizing academic papers and identifying key themes\nCreating first drafts of literature reviews\nTranslating research documents between major languages\nGenerating research questions and hypotheses to explore\nCoding assistance in most major languages (R, Python, STATA, etc..)\nWriting and formatting citations and bibliographies\n\nOutside the Frontier (AI struggles):\n\nGrasping context that isn’t explicitly stated\nMaking ethical judgments about research implications\nHumor. Seriously, try it. It’s all dad joke vibes\n\nThis unpredictability means you cannot assume that because AI handles one complex task well, it will handle a seemingly simpler related task with equal competence.",

    "text": "2.5 What LLMs Do Well vs. What They Don’t\n\n2.5.1 AI Strengths\nScale and Speed: LLMs can process vast amounts of text in seconds. Need to identify key themes across 50 research papers? AI can help you get started in minutes rather than weeks.\nPattern Recognition: AI excels at identifying patterns across large datasets of text, finding connections you might miss, and synthesizing information from multiple sources.\nFirst-Draft Generation: Whether it’s grant applications, literature reviews, or research summaries, AI can create useful first drafts that you can then refine with your expertise.\nLanguage Tasks: Translation, summarization, and style adaptation are genuine AI strengths that can save researchers enormous amounts of time.\n\n\n2.5.2 AI Limitations\nHallucination: LLMs confidently generate plausible-sounding but false information. They might cite papers that don’t exist, create realistic-sounding statistics, or confidently state “facts” they’ve essentially made up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Hallucination?\n\n\n\n“Hallucination” refers to when AI generates plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. This isn’t a bug—it’s how these models work. They predict what text should come next based on patterns, not facts. A hallucinated research paper might have a realistic title, believable authors, and a publication year that makes sense, but the paper simply doesn’t exist.\n\n\nCultural and Geographic Bias: LLMs are trained predominantly on text from wealthy countries in the Global North, often in English. They reflect the biases in that data and may default to Western-centric perspectives on development, governance, or social issues.\nMissing Context: AI only knows what’s explicitly written down. It misses the unspoken context that you understand from fieldwork—the power dynamics in a room, historical tensions between communities, or the significance of what isn’t being said.\nLack of True Understanding: When I read IMF documents, boring bureaucratic language often hides spicy geopolitical tensions that you can detect if you understand the context. AI reads the words but misses the subtext entirely.",
